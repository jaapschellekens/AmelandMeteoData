Procedure for Ameland meteo data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Getting the files 

(BTW this should all be done on the flow workstation)

a) Dail the station....... Running the get_aml_data.csh
script should do the trick (I hope). Otherwise use minicom
to do so manually.
- Number of station: 0,0519542200
- Mobile of Peter Metz: 0,0622062397
Ater this you should have a (compresses) file with a very long
name (present date and time); these are the data!

b) Place the file in the raw/ directory. The name of
this file should follow from the previous name (ie
if the last file was called ame1009.dat the new file
should be called ame1010.dat).


2. Processing the files

a) Use ame_dofile.m to convert a dowloaded file
to Octave/matlab format with correct data and time.
Afterwards add correction factors etc for the new
file to the ame_mkall[year] file!

b) Use ame_rep.m to generate a report of the newly added
data file. The report is made in .tex, .dvi and .ps format.
Check this report for data errors etc.

c) Use ame_mkall[year].m to generated the yearly files, this
script also performs some date checking and adjusting. You should
run this before make monthly reports etc.

d) Monthly reports can be generated from the year files using 
ame_mont.m (or the 8-8.m file for 12 hr means for WaterSchap 
Friesland)
